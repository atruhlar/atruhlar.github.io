<div class="panel-body">In 2016, the IO applied for a NYS Department of State grant to take the updated recommendations from the <a href="rpp.html">2017 Restoration and Protection Plan</a>, turn them into project ideas, and ready these ideas for applications for funding. The IO was awarded $62,000, which combined with local match, represents a total project cost of $124,000.<br><br>
The **current priority** of the IO is to work with the Central New York Regional Planning and Development Board and watershed muncipalities to envision projects, identify project partners, and develop project plans.<br><br>
